BoundedQueue for KPCB Fellows Application
============

Problem Description: 
Using only primitive types, implement a bounded queue to store integers. The data structure should be optimized for algorithmic runtime, memory usage, and memory throughput. No external libraries should be imported and/or used. The solution should be delivered in one class that provides the following functions:

 * constructor: class should provide one method for object creation that takes an integer to set the size of the queue.

 * enqueue: function should take an integer and store it in the queue if the queue isn't full. The function should properly handle the case where the queue is already full.
 
 * dequeue: function should return an integer if one is currently stored in the queue. The function should properly handle the case where the queue is empty.
